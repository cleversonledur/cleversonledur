### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cleverson Ledur. I am an experienced professional with strong knowledge of building scalable, resilient, reliable, solid, and complex systems. I hold a master's degree in Computer Science, and I am graduated in Information Systems.

In the last years, I worked in startups, small, and big tech companies with teams distributed across the world using agile methodologies to deliver high-quality products and services.

My most recent experiences are in developing high availability systems and in projects using Java, Kotlin, Go, and Python for the backend. And in frontend using JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, React, and SAP UI5. I also participated in projects using a vast set of other programming languages and tools.

I have working experience with cloud services in AWS and Azure platforms. Moreover, I am always studying and doing online courses on recent technologies. I love to learn about subjects related to new programming languages, tooling, automation, machine learning, startups, and entrepreneurship. I also love to share my knowledge and help other people to achieve their career goals.
